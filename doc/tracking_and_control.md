1. Tracking and Control Mechanisms

The quality of the final product, in our case the OMS application, is perhaps the most relevant factor that

determines whether the project was successfully completed or not. The project manager is the only person who is

directly responsible for the success of the project, and since that success is directly related to the quality of

software, we may conclude that there is a strong link between software quality and the project manager.

According to Juran (n.d.), it is absolutely necessary that the highest level of the organization’s management be

willing to implement quality, because from them the quality moves towards the lower levels of management, and

finally towards developers. That being said, we may constitute that the OMS project should have no obstacles in

fully adhering to high-quality.

The information on the desired level of quality will be obtained from the client, and the project manager will be in

charge of communicating that information to other members of the project team. When everyone fully

understands and work towards developing a high-quality software, then the project manager has promoted the

quality in the appropriate way.

In that regards, the following section of the OMS project plan contains a detailed description of quality assurance

planning, implementation and controlling techniques that will be used in the OMS project.


1.1. Quality assurance and control

Quality assurance system is a mechanism that applies the principles of quality management in the organization.

The system involves activities that have an impact on the quality of the end product, including the organizational

structure, procedures, responsibilities, resources, and processes required to implement quality management. We

can categorize these activities into quality planning, assurance, and control, as described in the following sub-

sections.

1.1.1. Quality planning

Software quality planning is the initial activity in the quality management process in which the project manager

identifies the quality standards that are relevant for the project. Identified quality standards derive from existing

international standards, as well as direct and indirect user requirements. Unlike other project activities, quality

planning involves the most intensive communication with the customer, due to the fact that it is necessary to

clearly and unambiguously define the desired level of software quality in an understandable and final form. The

documents that arise from the planning process need to describe what factors or processes, methods, and tools

will impact the establishment of the desired level of quality (Schwalbe, 2006: 295). The basic documents include

the quality management plan and the quality checklist used by the project team to focus on the most important

activities in the course of the project.

Our organization adheres to ISO 9126 standards in the software development, therefore the OMS system will be

developed and implemented in accordance with these standards. The ISO 9126 standard defines specified

software characteristics, as well as the process of evaluating software quality (Abran, 2003). According to these

standards, there are six general characteristics of quality software: Functionality (the existence of software

functions or their designated properties), Reliability (ability of the software to maintain the level of performance

under defined conditions, during the specified period), Usability (sustainability for use, or complexity for the end

user), Efficiency (the relationship between the level of performance of the software and the amount of resources

that are used under named conditions), Sustainability (the ability of the software to easily support future

modifications), Portability (the ability of software to be transferred from one workplace to another).


In addition to named software characteristics, the OMS system will have to fully adhere to the defined user

requirements. The user requirement specification will be developed as a separate document and delivered to all

members of the team. The document will be fully evaluated and discussed on the initial team meeting, and

appropriate evaluation, verification and testing of these requirements will be done by the project manager and the

testing team thought the life cycle of the project.

The complete list of quality standards, policies, tools and methods which will be used in the OMS project will be

specified in the OMS project SQA plan. The SQA plan will be delivered as a separate document, together with the

specification requirements document, and discussed on the team meeting. It is the responsibility of the project

manager to explain and emphasize the importance of these documents and adherence to the requirements,

standards, and policies contained within them.

1.1.2. Quality assurance

After defining the quality management plan, the project manager has the responsibility of ensuring that his team

follows the quality specification. This phase is called quality assurance, and its main functions are to ensure the

monitoring of quality standards and continuous improvement of the quality.

The process of quality assurance in the OMS project can be structured as follows:

- The project manager is in charge of daily reviewing and reporting the project quality status (Project

manager will conduct daily project measurements in order to develop a repository of performance data

and generate software quality assurance reports for the stakeholders and senior management).

- The project testing team is in charge of continuously conducting integration and system testing and

reporting errors or deviations from defined quality standards and/or user requirements (as outlined in

section 6.1.3.)

- The development team is in charge of fully adhering to the Test Driven Development principles and

developing unit tests for all application logic

- The documentation team is in charge of continuously developing the user documentation, translating the

localization files, and ensuring that all newly implemented application strings are fully lectured


One of the most important tools for ensuring the quality is audit. Quality audit, as explained by Galin (2004),

implies a structured review of all activities in the field of quality management and proposed amendments to

standards, procedures and practices, in order to improve the quality and performance of the project team. In that

regard, after the completion of each project phase (design, development and implementation) a formal quality

audit will be conducted in order to benchmark the defined quality standards against the developed quality of the

OMS system. Any deviations found during the audit will be reported back to the project manager, and the final

report signed by the OMS steering committee. Recommendations on quality improvements that result from PM’s

daily reviews and quality audits will be discussed on team meetings and infiltrated into the project plan and

development iterations. In addition, all errors, deviations and recommendations will be documented and uploaded

to our Team Foundation Server (together with the rest of the project documentation) in order to provide a

‘Lessons Learned’ resource for future projects.
