1. Tracking and Control Mechanisms

The quality of the final product, in our case the OMS application, is perhaps the most relevant factor that

determines whether the project was successfully completed or not. The project manager is the only person who is

directly responsible for the success of the project, and since that success is directly related to the quality of

software, we may conclude that there is a strong link between software quality and the project manager.

According to Juran (n.d.), it is absolutely necessary that the highest level of the organizationâ€™s management be

willing to implement quality, because from them the quality moves towards the lower levels of management, and

finally towards developers. That being said, we may constitute that the OMS project should have no obstacles in

fully adhering to high-quality.

The information on the desired level of quality will be obtained from the client, and the project manager will be in

charge of communicating that information to other members of the project team. When everyone fully

understands and work towards developing a high-quality software, then the project manager has promoted the

quality in the appropriate way.

In that regards, the following section of the OMS project plan contains a detailed description of quality assurance

planning, implementation and controlling techniques that will be used in the OMS project.
