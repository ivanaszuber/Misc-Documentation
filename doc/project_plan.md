2. Business Goals and Project Goals


Business Goal


Automatic development of offers for domestic and foreign customers from the data contained in the system.
Tracking of available stock, reserving available stock, ordering out-of-stock products.

The Offer Monitoring system should present an invaluable support in decision making at various levels of management and every day operational  work; such as quick access to information, an ease report, the establishment and operational execution of workflows (process access) (Shtub, 2009:123). In addition, a user-friendly system should provide an integrated solution where by the wise management one can reach all the necessary information interesting to the offer management department.


Project Goal

Design, develop and implement an automated, dynamic offer monitoring system by Q1 2014.

Project goal is to develop and implement an integrated, process-oriented Offer Monitoring System, which contains all the elements for keeping up-to-date information about the companyâ€™s offers. The system should consist of a series of ready- made solutions, which by using a methodological approach, should adapt to organizations of various activities  and industries. All parts of the system should contain the same rules and standardized operation, and be very easy to use.

The basic features of the Offer Management System should include:
-     Process approach
-     Documentation System
-     Security
-     Administration

The final goal is to develop a centralized offer management  system. All data is to be stored in a central database and data access achieved by the client program.
Client server architecture is to be used to support operations, entering information into the system, configuration of the system and the use of peripheral devices (printers, scanners, bar code readers ...).


The Offer Monitoring System should consist of the following layers:

1.  Basic functionality:
-     Layer for data storage (databases)
-     User Interface


2.  Service functions:
-     Automatic upgrade by new versions
-     Reporting system
-     LDAP directory service for user authentication (Active Directory)
